    This program is a version of DJikstras shortest path algorithem. 
    It uses a hard coded graph and can give you the shortest distances 
    from the start node(0) to every other node. 
    
    I was attempting C level though it has some bugs still. 
    
    "C Level (45-54): Code compiles and runs without crashing. Correctly implements Di- jkstra’s single-source shortest path algorithm using an adjacency matrix and the Find- Min approach to determining the next node to “visit.”" - Canvas

        Started research on topic, looking in the book and watched two videos on how to impliment the shortest path algorithm.

        Started typing up the H and C file for the matrix. I figured I would start from the bottom on this project. Looked at some ways to type this because I am confused. How do you make a matrix....

        I looked at more and typed up more code in the C and H on the Matrix and the arrays. Arrays were allot easier than I thought.

        Finished with the holidays and working. Now I worked on compiling the arrays and the matrix, both worked great. Now the issue of where to start with the actual finding path. I keep trying ideas but nothing is working. AHHH.

        Went to office hours and now I have a rough outline of what to type up. I have gotten it up and now need to go back and change the arrays and matrix to work with it.

        Now it is all typed up but does not compile. I am working on it and I have figured it out. Now it compiles and shows out numbers. Next goal is to finds the issues in the shortest path.

        I have gotten the shortest path but only if I hard code it. I am now going to do try to accept cin for the nodes and the weights.

        I hate this project. I could not figure out the cin and when I tried to swtich back it is not working. All I did was change the cin form hard code and its bad now. I have spent allot of time on fixing this and it seems impossible.

        The boolean is not working causing it to not increment. I cant get past the first node. Mikey G says to be a better detective and now I am trying a shot gun approach by having it C out every thing. 
        
    May 1st 2017 (4 hrs)
        I got it back to hard coding and working. I am done and hope to be finished.
